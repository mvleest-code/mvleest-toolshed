# toolshed

Welcome to my toolshed, my personal collection of random tools that I use sometimes. This is not a polished repository—this is a shed, plain and simple.

---

## What is This?

This is where I throw in scripts, utilities, and other tools I've built, borrowed, or experimented with. Some are useful, some are questionable, and some might break at any moment.

---

## How It Works

1. **Tools Come and Go**  
   Tools will be added when I need them and removed when they’re broken, irrelevant, or just annoying me. No promises that anything here will stick around.

2. **Use at Your Own Risk**  
   Like any shed, things might be rusty. Tools here aren’t guaranteed to work perfectly (or at all). If something breaks, don’t blame the shed.

3. **No Guarantees**  
   Expect chaos. This is not a curated toolbox—this is a place for oddities and experiments.

## Why?

Because every developer needs a dumping ground for random ideas, scripts, and utilities. This is mine. If you find something useful, great. If not, that’s fine too.
